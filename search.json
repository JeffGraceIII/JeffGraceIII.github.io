    "text": "Get ready, basketball fans, because one of the most thrilling times of the year is almost here: NBA Playoffs! As the regular season comes to an end, the anticipation and excitement ramp up as teams across the league gear up for the ultimate showdown.\nIn the upcoming NBA playoffs, wanted to figure out who has the best possible chance to win.\nOne team is standing out in the predictions, the Celtics. With their new lineup and recent performances, they’re being known as the ones to beat. However, in the ever-unpredictable world of basketball, nothing is set in stone. Other teams are lurking in the shadows, ready to seize their chance at glory.\nSo, as we dive into the upcoming playoffs, brace yourselves for a roller coaster ride of emotions, surprises, and intense battles on the court. Will the Celtics live up to the hype, or will an underdog rise to the occasion? Let the games begin!\n2023-24 NBA Reference- is what was used for data and it highlights many different stats for other seasons along with the 2023-24 NBA Season. Advanced Stats was the specific stat that was looked at for the data. It shows a variety of things along with the four offensive and defensive factors.\nWhich teams have the highest offensive and defensive rating per 100 possessions heading into the NBA Playoffs is the first thing we will look at.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse )\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nBasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"NBA.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=Basketball, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ORtg), x=ORtg, xend=DRtg),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightblue\",\n    colour_x = \"orange\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Offensive Rating vs Defensive Rating in the NBA\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;Offenseive Rating&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good. If &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Defensive Rating&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's bad.\",\n    x=\"Offensive rating per 100 possesions\", \n    y=\"Defensive rating per 100 possesions\", \n    caption=\"Source: 2023-24 NBA Season Summary  | Jeff Grace III\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Boston Celtics stand out among both Eastern and Western Conference teams, boasting one of the highest defensive ratings and the best offensive rating. Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers, ranked in the middle defensively, showcased their skill as the second-best offensive team in the east, proving their effectiveness on both ends of the court. The possibility of these two strong teams facing up in the Eastern Conference playoffs is becoming more and more exciting as the postseason approaches.\nCould this potential clash deliver a showdown of offensive firepower versus defensive mastery that basketball fans have been waiting for?\n\n\nCode\nbee1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=Basketball, aes(x=`OeFG%`, y=Conference),color=\"orange\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Basketball,aes(x=`OeFG%`, y=Conference, label=Team))+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Offensive effective field goal percentage\",\n    y= \"Teams Conference\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n  \nbee2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n geom_beeswarm(data=Basketball, aes(x=`DeFG%`, y=Conference),color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Basketball,aes(x=`DeFG%`, y=Conference, label=Team))+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Defensive effective field goal perecentage\",\n    y= \"Teams Conference\",\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n  \nbee1 / bee2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Offensive effective field goal percentage vs Defensive effective field goal percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"The Boston Celtics offense and defense, on a per play basis, were the top in NBA.\",\n    caption = \"Source: 2023-24 NBA Season Summary | Jeff Grace III\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Celtics offensive talent remain impressive, showcasing an effective field goal percentage that stands tall across both Eastern and Western Conferences. Yet, their defensive performance paints a different picture, boasting one of the Eastern Conference’s finest defensive effective field goal percentages.\nCan their offensive talent, however, make up for defensive shortcomings throughout the playoffs?\n\n\nCode\nnewbasketball &lt;- Basketball |&gt; \n  filter(\n   Pace &gt; 97.3 &\n    W &gt; 25\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=Basketball, aes(x=W, y=Pace), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=newbasketball, aes(x=W, y=Pace), color=\"orange\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 98.58333, color=\"lightblue\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 36.33333, color=\"lightblue\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=50, y=101.8, label=\"Playing fast, winning games\"), color=\"darkgrey\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=newbasketball, aes(x=W, y=Pace, label=Team))  + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins\", \n    y=\"Pace per 100 possesions\", \n    title=\"Pace doesn't determine the win column\", \n    subtitle=\"The Oklahoma City Thunder's pace were among the top in the NBA.\", \n    caption=\"Source: 2023-24 NBA Season Summary | Jeff Grace III\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPace influences the flow and tempo of a game, but it’s impact on playoff results is varied. While a faster pace may favor teams with explosive offenses like the Thunder, allowing them to capitalize on transition opportunities and catch opponents off guard, it also presents risks. Speeding up the game can lead to increased turnovers and fatigue, which could benefit opponents who thrive in a more controlled, half-court style of play.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder’s ability to control the game’s pace may be crucial in their hopes finishing out the regular season and heading into playoffs.\nSo, does pace determine who wins or loses in the playoffs?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "A few players stand out in the enormous field of professional basketball history due to their extraordinary talent, perseverance, and pure willpower. Derrick Rose, a name associated with both success and hardship, is one of these notable individuals. Rose is an inspiration and a symbol of resilience despite everything that can happen throughout a sporting career, as seen by his journey of highs and lows.\nDerrick Rose made his NBA debut in 2008 after the Chicago Bulls selected him with the first overall choice. He has an individual blend of athleticism, quickness, and finesse. His thrilling style of play won him the prized title of NBA Rookie of the Year in 2009, winning over hearts all across the world. Rose’s rise was unchecked, as seen by his 2011 achievement of becoming the youngest MVP in NBA history and his unmatched skill and leadership on the floor.\nHowever, Rose’s path to greatness was not without its challenges. His career was impacted by injuries, which created a risk to the bright future he was striving so hard to establish. A collection of misfortunes that would put Rose’s perseverance to the test like never before began with an ACL tear during the 2012 playoffs. Rose faced an impossible uphill climb to regain his proper place among the NBA elite, despite suffering grueling rehabilitation procedures and many surgeries.\nFor my data, I referred to an NBA basketball reference. The look at the data included the seasons of 2011 through 2014 in the NBA. This was both before and after Derrick Rose was injured. The data category that was selected is advanced statistics.\nFirst, a slope chart will be used to examine the percentage of Derrick Rose usage rate from 2011 to 2014.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nstats2010 &lt;- read_csv(\"2009-10.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2010, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nstats2011 &lt;- read_csv(\"2010-11.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2011, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nstats2012 &lt;- read_csv(\"2011-12.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2012, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nstats2014 &lt;- read_csv(\"2013-14.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2014, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\nstats &lt;- bind_rows(stats2010, stats2011, stats2012, stats2014)\n\ntwoyearstats &lt;- bind_rows(stats2011, stats2014)\nnoncarmelo &lt;- twoyearstats |&gt; \n  filter(Player != \"Carmelo Anthony\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == 2011) |&gt; \n  filter(`USG%` &gt; 30)\n\ncarmelo &lt;- twoyearstats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Carmelo Anthony\") |&gt; \n  filter(Season == 2011) |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"TOT\")\n\ntopusage &lt;- bind_rows(noncarmelo, carmelo) |&gt; pull(Player)\n\ntopusage2011 &lt;- bind_rows(noncarmelo, carmelo)\n\ntopusage2014 &lt;- twoyearstats |&gt; filter(Season == 2014) |&gt; \n  filter(Player %in% topusage)\n\nusage &lt;- bind_rows(topusage2011, topusage2014)\n\ndrusage &lt;- usage |&gt; filter(Player==\"Derrick Rose\")\nnousage &lt;- usage |&gt; filter(Player== \"Amar'e Stoudemire\")\nkousage &lt;- usage |&gt; filter(Player==\"Kobe Bryant\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=usage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=usage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"grey\") +\ngeom_line(data=drusage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=drusage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data= nousage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_point(data=nousage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"orange\") +\n  geom_line(data= kousage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=kousage, aes(x=Season, y=`USG%`, group=Player),\n  color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_text(data=drusage |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label= Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=drusage |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label= Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=nousage |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label=Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=nousage |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=kousage |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label=Player)) + \n  geom_text(data=kousage |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .2, y=`USG%`+.4, group=Player, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Years\", \n    y=\"Usage Rate\", \n    title=\"Rose stays consitent even after injury\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago Bulls guard usage percentage from 2011 to 2014\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Jeff Grace III\"\n    ) +\nscale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2011, 2014), limits=c(2010.4,2015.5)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral players in the NBA had changes in their usage rates between 2011 and 2014; Derrick Rose, Amar’e Stoudemire, and Kobe Bryant showed notable patterns. Interestingly, Derrick Rose, in spite of severe injury setbacks, continued to play a fairly consistent usage percentage over this time, demonstrating his essential importance in his team’s offensive schemes. Rose’s ability to stay involved demonstrates his skill set and value to the strategies used by his team.\nWhat specific strategies or adjustments do you think teams and players can implement to maintain or increase their usage rates over time, especially in the face of challenges such as injuries, aging, or changes in team dynamics?\n\n\nCode\ndrusagewaffle &lt;- c(\"Rookie\"=23.5, \"Fifth year\"=9.7, 8.3) \nkousagewaffle &lt;- c(\"Rookie\"=23.9, \"Fifth year\"=10.7, 6.9)\nnousagewaffle &lt;- c(\"Rookie\"=22.7, \"Fifth year\"=18.8)\niron(\nwaffle(\n  drusagewaffle,\n  rows=5,\n    colors =  c(\"red\", \"black\", \"white\")) +\n  labs (\n    x= \"Derrick Rose\",\n    title=\"Derrick Rose PER decreases after injury\",\n  subtitle=\"Injuries play a major role in sports and hurt the bulls.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n),\nwaffle(\n  kousagewaffle,\n  rows=5,\n   colors =  c(\"purple\", \"yellow\", \"white\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Kobe Bryant\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n),\nwaffle(\n  nousagewaffle,\n  rows=5,\n  colors =  c(\"orange\", \"blue\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Amar'e Stoudemire\",\n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Graphic by: Jeff Grace III\"\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Derrick Rose’s and Kobe Bryant’s Player Efficiency Ratings (PER) decreased, which was reflective of changes in their own circumstances and performances. The difficulties they encountered affected both players’ effectiveness on the court despite their tremendous talents and contributions to their teams. In comparison to Rose and Bryant, Amar’e Stoudemire’s PER declined slowly, enabling him to keep his efficiency rating high. This period of sustained efficiency was largely due to Stoudemire’s ability to adjust his game and stay efficient in the face of obstacles like injuries and shifting team dynamics.\nWhat effect did Derrick Rose’s Player Efficiency Rating have on his career status from 2011 to 2014?\n\n\nCode\ntsplayer &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(\n   `TS%` &gt; 0 &\n     Tm != \"TOT\" &\n     MP &gt; 1000\n  )\nrose &lt;- usage |&gt; filter(Player ==\"Derrick Rose\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=tsplayer, aes(x=`TS%`, y=OBPM), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=usage, aes(x=`TS%`, y=OBPM), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=usage, aes(x=`TS%`, y=OBPM, label=PlayerSeason)) +\n  geom_point(data=rose, aes(x=`TS%`, y=OBPM), color=\"#CE1141\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"TS%\", \n    y=\"OBPM\", \n    title=\"Rose isn't as effective as he was before ACL injury\", \n    subtitle=\"Chicago Bulls player game changes from 2011 to 2014\",\n    caption=\"Source: 2011-14 NBA Season advanced stats | Jeff Grace III\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a number of obstacles, Derrick Rose was a skilled and valuable offensive player from 2011. He showed consistency in both his true shooting % and offensive box plus/minus during this time. During the time of 2014 his true shooting % and offensive box plus/ minus decreased after the injury. In 2011 Rose’s true shooting percentage displayed his ability to effectively add to his team’s scoring output. There will always be a “what if” in NBA and Chicago Bulls history between 2011 and 2014.\nWhat would have happened to the bulls and Derrick Rose’s career if he had remained injury-free during this period?"
